# This GitHub Workflow is designed to run automatically after the Release PR, which was created by the `Create Release PR` workflow, is closed.
# This workflow has 2 jobs. One will run if the `Release PR` is successfully merged, indicating that a release should go out.
# The other will run if the `Release PR` was closed and a release is not intended to go out.
